Unbreakable screwdriver
=======================

This is a Minetest(http://www.minetest.net) mod. Minetest is an infinite-world block sandbox game and a game engine, inspired by InfiniMiner, Minecraft and the like.

This mod adds the possibility to modify the wear of "Screwdriver Redo By TenPlus1".

To adjust the wear, write a value between 0 and 65535 after wear_set_by_user in <modpath>/screwdriver.conf .
If you entered an invalid value or if the file doesn't exist, a new one with a default value of 0 is (re)created.
Changes are applied upon reboot.

Setting the value to 0 will make it unbreakable.
For the standard screwdriver wear, set value to 300.
